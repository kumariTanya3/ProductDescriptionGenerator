Project Title: 
"Product Description Generator with Marketing Angle"

Problem Statement:
E-commerce businesses often struggle to write compelling and SEO-friendly product
descriptions that appeal to their target audience. Manually writing these descriptions for
hundreds of products is time-consuming and inconsistent in tone.
Goal: Build a tool that takes a basic product name and features, and generates a creative
product title, followed by a marketing-optimized product description, using a SequentialChain.
Sequential Steps:
1. Step 1 (Chain 1): Generate a creative and catchy product title based on the Input product
name and features.
2. Step 2 (Chain 2): Use the generated product title to create a compelling product description
with a marketing tone.
Inputs:
product_name: e.g., "Wireless Earbuds"
features: e.g., "Noise cancellation, 12-hour battery life, Bluetooth 5.3"
Outputs:
title: "SilentBeats: The Next-Gen Wireless Sound”
description: "Experience crystal-clear sound like never before. With SilentBeats, Immerse
yourself in music thanks to advanced noise cancellation, seamless Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity,
and a 12-hour battery that powers your day.”
